# Cursor Rules for toolhive-doc-mcp

**IMPORTANT**: Before working on code, read and follow the guidelines in `CLAUDE.md`.

The `CLAUDE.md` file contains:
- Code quality requirements (linting, complexity, style)
- Build and development commands
- Project overview and configuration details

Always ensure PRs pass linting checks before committing. See `CLAUDE.md` for details.
